<!-- HTML Files must start with a doc type declaration -->
<!DOCTYPE html>

<!-- The HTML document itself is contained inside the HTML element, which looks like this: -->
<html>

<!-- Most HTML elements are composed of two HTML tags, like this: -->
	<head>
		<!-- Content -->
	</head>

<!-- The Head Element (defined above) contains data not displayed on the redered page, such as the site title and links to external style sheets

The other main Element of an HTML Document is the body, which contains what will actually be seen by users.
 -->
 	<body>
 		<p> Hello World! </p>
 	</body>

 <!-- This body element contains a paragraph element (<p>) that contains the text "Hello World". This will be displayed on the page if we were to open this file in a browser. Now we just have to close the html element. elements are closed by using the tag with a "/" inside the brackets-->
</html>

<!-- If You Run this you should see a white background with "Hello World!" displayed in small black type -->

<!-- TLDR: 
	Basic HTML File Structure:
	<!DOCTYPE html>
	<html>
		<head></head>
		<body></body>
	</html
